                    The following steps are required to fill up the On-line application form:
                    Before proceeding to fill-up the On-Line Application Form, the candidates are required to read the
                    following instructions given below :<br><br><br>

                    <b>Step-1: </b>Profile Registration
                    Please use this step to give general information about you to register the profile. For profile
                    registration, you need to have a valid email-id. In case, you donâ€™t have the same, please create an
                    email-id before proceeding for profile registration. During profile registration, you need to set a
                    password of length of 6 to 10 characters. No two online application forms can be filled with a
                    single email-id; therefore if a candidate is willing to apply for two or more courses, he/she needs
                    two or more email-ids so that for each course a separate online application form with a unique
                    email-ID can be filled. The details of fields in the online application form have been illustrated
                    in section-B. After entering the required information in On-line form, submit the form by clicking
                    on SUBMIT button. A mail containing login information will be forwarded at your registered
                    email-id.

                    Please note down the admission form number carefully as you need to essentially mention it in all
                    your future correspondence/queries related to your application form.<br><br><br>

                    whether the payment is processed or not, then please use login tab to enter in your login account
